This is a React-based school timetable management system built with TypeScript, Vite, and Supabase. The application allows educational institutions to:
Manage teachers, subjects, classrooms, and classes
Create and modify lesson schedules
Build and visualize timetables
Import/export schedule data from JSON and Excel files
The project uses a modern tech stack including:
React 18 with TypeScript
Vite for fast development and building
Supabase for backend database and authentication
Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for the UI
React Router for navigation
DND Kit for drag-and-drop functionality
The application has a modular structure with separate components for different management areas (teachers, rooms, classes, etc.) and a timetable builder for creating and visualizing schedules. It also includes data import/export capabilities for integration with external systems.
